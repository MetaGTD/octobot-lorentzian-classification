# octobot-lorentzian-classification
OctoBot Lorentzian Classification evaluator, based on the trading view indicator from Â©jdehorty https://www.tradingview.com/script/WhBzgfDu-Machine-Learning-Lorentzian-Classification/

# Still work in progress!
## To Do
* RMA is slightly different as on trading view (probably not a rounding issue)
* gaussian method returns slightly different as on tradingview (probably rounding issue)
* classify_current_candle / prediction is different (probably my implementation is not replicating the original code OR because of differences of available candle data lengths)
